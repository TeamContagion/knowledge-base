# Forensics Introduction

Digital forensics takes on a different form between CTFs and the real world.

Within CTFs forensics challenges are more akin to puzzles: analyzing, processing, and recovering hidden data out of static files. You might extract a corrupted image fime out of a disk dump, which when repaired turns into a QR code that links to an MP3 file, whose spectrograph contains the flag.

By contrast, in the real world, forensics takes the form of recovering and analyzing data left on a computer, mainly for use as evidence in a court of law. In this case, one is often looking for evidence of malicious action.
