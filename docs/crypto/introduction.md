Cryptography is the science of secret writing with the goal of hiding the meaning of a message. In the modern day, this is done with math. Usually complicated math. If you can't stand math then I'm sorry crypto is probably not going to be your favorite.

In CTFs, the goal is typically to defeat a cryptographic system. This can take several forms, including but not limited to: 
brute forcing (somewhat rare, almost always has some way to make the brute forcing more efficient), finding an error in their implementation that makes the encryption weak, exploiting weak parameters, and/or replicating a well known attack.

## Skills to know
- Python
- Math, especially discrete math
- Knowledge of common encryption schemes and cryptanalysis methods
